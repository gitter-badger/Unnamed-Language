## Goals of Unnamed Language ##
* General purpose programming language
* Comparatively quick compile-time and running speeds
  * Clean LL(1) grammar
  * Deterministic Memory Management
  * Zero-cost abstractions
  * Optional run-time bound checking etc.
  * Easy parallelization
  * Compile-time runnable code
* Minimal Boilerplate
  * Compiler `classpath` similar to Java
  * Using classes as filenames
  * Using directories as namespaces
* Guarantee non-machine specific algorithms to work any machine with sufficient memory
  * Plain Old Data (POD) types must work on any machine
  * Objects using POD types must work on any machine
  * Optional 'safe' tag to denote defined behavior
* Self-documenting code
  * Const correctness
  * Optional Functional Purity
  * Forced named parameter passing
  * Names part of function signatures
  * Strong, static typing
  * No ternary operator: if-else can be inside an expression too.
* Ease of coding
  * Nested block comments
  * `Conservative` Operator Overloading (Can not define new operators. Same operator precedence as for arithmetic.)
  * Function overloading
  * Template Metaprogramming
  * Mass Array Operations ([32s] :+ 32s will add the right argument to each element in the array, creating and returning a new array)
  * Aspect-Oriented Programming
  * Dislodged if-else
* Obvious Behavior
  * No infix/postfix ++ and -- expressions (due to uncertainty of order of evaluation)
  * No boolean short-circuiting
  * Method-Class-Type suffixing for documentation and assertion of types (e.g.: +::32s)
  * Strict evaluation
  * Encapsulation to prevent unwanted code tinkering
  * No inheritance, only pseudo-inheritance
